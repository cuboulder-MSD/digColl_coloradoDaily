The exhibit was put together to commemo - rate the 20th anniversary of July 26, 1953, a national holiday marking the beginning of the Cuban liberation war lead by Fidel Castro. Starting with the 1953 slaughter of more than 70 revolutionary soldiers at the Moncada barracks by then-dictator Fulgencio Batista, the photography display vividly contrasts conditions in Cuba's past and present. Photos are arranged in two parts, the verti - cal “totems” at each end of the exhibit and the horizontal “paravan.” The totem at the east end describes the attack on Moncada, as well as pre-revolutionary social and political conditions. The other totem illustrates the in - tensification of the battlefield and ideological revolution. Progress in agriculture, education, medicine and industry are all documented on the paravan. Pictures of new housing are dis - played next to the crowded tenements of the past. Children with bloated bellies caused by malnutrition face those of children brimming with good health. Sports, once a pastime for the wealthy, has become a national priority complete with all the trimmings of mass sports elsewhere, in - cluding cheerleaders. Culture, too, has been made available to the masses through art schools, subsidized film - making and increased book printing. Cuban film is recognized as among the most innova - tive in the world, and several of the industry’s movies have won awards at international film festivals. In 1958 only 2 million books were pub lished in Cuba. By 1972 Cuban presses were turning out 23 million volumes. Improvements in health care and education are perhaps revolutionary Cuba’s greatest achievements. In 15 years illiteracy was al - most abolished from its high rate of 23 per cent in 1958. Medical care is free to everyone now, and infant mortality has been reduced from 3 per cent to 0.8 per cent. The photos are both inspiring and disquiet - ing when one realizes how far Cuba has come and how much further it has to go, especially in the area of individual freedoms. One of the pictures shows a mass rally with a banner proclaiming “Cuba y Chile — Her - manns en la Lucha” (Cuba and Chile — brothers in the Struggle). The exhibit is sponsored by the Latin American Student Group and the Cultural Events Board. daily photo by john puemer Supreme Court upholds federal ownership of off-shore oil rights By WILLIAM L. CHAZE Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON — Adminis - tration plans to open the Atlan - tic to oil drilling cleared a major stumbling block Monday when the Supreme Court up - held federal ownership of the offshore resources. A unanimous court rejected the claim of coastal states that colonial charters granted by the English and Dutch gave them domain over a 1 00-mile-wide belt of the Atlantic off their coasts. The court ruled separately against efforts by Louisiana and Texas to claim offshore areas beyond a boundary drawn by a special Supreme Court master. Both contended the boundary ignored their historical control over offshore areas awarded the government. An Interior Department spokesman said the Atlantic ruling freed the department to ask oil companies to recom - mend areas for leasing, a pre - liminary step in the leasing process. “I don’t think we'll rush out tomorrow to do that, but we should be able to do it soon,'' said the spokesman The department had asked for this recommendations last month, but Secretary Rogers Cl). Morton rescinded the invi I at io n when reminded o I an earlier promise to make no such move before the court’s ruling. Morton said he was pleased by the ruling and as sured coastal governors “we will continue our policy of early and frequent discussion with them as we proceed to - ward the development of this precious resource.” Maine Gov. James B. Longley said he was disappointed by the ruling and hoped the court based its decision on more valid information than the Ford administration presented in its arguments. At issue in the case were administration plans to accel - erate offshore leasing as a key part of its program to reduce the nation’s dependency upon foreign oil. The administration intends to lease 10 million acres during the next year, including 3.5 million acres off the Atlantic Coast.

The losing ways continued into the regular Big Eight sea - son. as the Buffs made their debut in Norman against Ok - lahoma and were annihilated 11 3-82. Finally, on Feb. 5. the Buffs Can thev help turn around this year's dismal 7-19 record? I'he Hutts opened the season against the Iniversitv ot California (Berkely) with a voting and inexperienced team and were Ix'aten soundly 98-78 They returned home tor a live - game homestand, winning three of five although play ing sloppily and inconsistently The three wins. however, were against average teams: St .ouis. .Air Forte. and San Diego state, whii h lost to Neyada-Las y egas in the NCAA tournament iast weekend. Then the root c aved in l ac - mg a seven-game 1 road trip, the Buffs lost all of the contests by wide margins. Included in those losses were three defeats at the hands ot lowa State. Mis - souri. and Oklahoma State in the annual pre-season Big Eight tournament in Kansas City. The closest Colorado could come to a winning effort was a 7 3-57 loss to Missouri. snapped an 11-game losing streak by thrashing Oklahoma State 1 8 3-82. I'he win was the l first for ('.olorado since’ their one-point victory over San Diego State on Dec 19. Not being able to withstand the prosperity, the Buffs suf - fered road losses at Missouri and Kansas State. But then the season began to change. I'he inexperience l began to show less frequently as the c lub began to mature. In their final six games, the Buffs played competitively with all the teams they faced, excluding a regionally televised game against lowa State l when they were wallopped 1 19-98 by the last place Cy c lones. There was a marked im - provement as the seniors played steadily and the l freshmen played with confi - dence Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri went down to de- feats at the hands of the ""new Buffs."" Looking back on the season. Coach Sox Walseth said. ""It was a rough year. However. I don't think I've been any prouder of a team. After being kicked around, they came back and became respectable It was gratifying to see the seniors hang on the way they did."" The seniors he was speaking of are Tony Lawrence, Ron Wrigley. Fred McDonald and Bruno Konopka. Lawrence is the only one yvho appears to be irreplaceable at the present t i me. When discussill this year's recruiting efforts. Walseth said. ""We'll have to recruit some guards."" Walseth was referring to the absence' of Lawrence, the team's shooting guard yvho led the 1 tc am in scoring with 1 5.6 points per game. Lawrence's departure, coupled with Brad Hunt's decision to drop out of school, leaves the Buffs without an able outside shooting guard. Wrigley 's and McDonald's starting positions should be til - led more than ably by Larry Vaculik and Dave Logan, yvho sat out the season with a foot - ball injury after scoring 16 points per game a year ago. Vaculik. at 6'B"". will be the center and could blossom into one of the school's finest players Logan, only - 6'5”. more than compensates for his height, with his fine leaping ability Greg Mueller, a sophomore starter throughout the past sea - son. will join Vaculik and Logan on the front line. Muel - ler is a fine offensive player with a good outside shooting touch who should improve his 13 point per game average. Sophomore |av Sferra, a slick dribbler and passer, will proba - bly return as the playmaking guard If Sferra can cut down on his turnovers and learn to control his crowd-pleasing game, he might turn into the Big Eight assist champion. Freshmen forwards Font Wente and Kurt Schoenhoft. who proved that they can re - bound during the course of the season, will also be counted on heavily in the future. Schoenhoff came on strongly near the end of the year with some fine offensive board work and scoring Wente will have to develop an offensive game if he is to see much action Alvin Berry, an All-City player from Detroit who saw limited action as a freshman this season, is also expected to make a major contribution. Ber - ry. however, may be too short and light for the forward posi - tion he plays. His 6'4"". 185 pound frame seems better suited for a backcourt slot. Jim Cummins, presently' re - covering from knee surgery after being injured in the third game of the season, should add backcourt depth with his 6’5 height. However, he is not the answer to the Buffs' need for a shooting guard. If Colorado is able to recruit a shooting guard, the Buffs could become next season's Big Eight miracle team, from last place to a championship contender. If not. Logan would probably have to move into the backcourt and the Buffs' for - tunes could go in any direction.

Both coach Dave Wardell and assistant coach Rick Danley had forecast last week that the Buff gymnasts would probably take the third position behind lowa State and Nebras - ka, and that was exactly the order of finishing. lowa State, the defending Big Eight, as well as national champion, won three individual firsts to tally 422.85 points for the team title. Nebraska followed with 413.60 and Cl I was third with a score of 390.10. The University gymnasts had to hold off Oklahoma to nail down the third position, however, as the Sooners finished less than three points behind the Buffs with 387.35 points. The top three finishers in each event qual - ified for the NCAA finals on April 3 in India- na. but CU could only manage to qualify one gymnast. The lone qualifier for the University was Eric Black, who managed to break into the top three places in side horse competition. Black had a score of 17.125 on the pommel horse to win third place. The CU team’s sole graduating senior, Kirk Meier, vaulted to a fifth place finish in the vaulting competition. Another fifth place went to Frey McDowell for his performance on the high bar Also placing high for the University were freshman Dale Wiles and sophomore Jack Car - ter. who each took sixth place in their event. Carter’s mark of 16.6 was good for sixth in the parallel bars, while teammate Wiles had a similar finish on the still rings. I hree CU gymnasts also managed to place well in the all-around scoring, with Jeff Wat - kins seventh, Mike Dewitt eighth and Randy Grubb tenth in this competition. Watkins also achieved an eighth place finish in the vault Loveland.

With the masses going to Copper Mountain and Vail, Loveland has weekday skiing every weekend. Loveland has always been a family area. It's a ""homey” place where toddlers play in t he snow outside I he lodge and middle-agers catch a few Z’s during lunch. However, Loveland hasn't failed to keep pace with bigger areas. The basin has five lifts; three chairs, at-bar, and a poma that service some of the most well-groomed and diver - sified terrain anywhere. Love - land's average annual snow - fall is 280 inches so rocks are few and far between. Chairlift 1 gives access to some of the steepest slopes in (Colorado.

Chair 2 serves the easiest slopes on the mountain and provides access to the 1.5 mile Eirecut.

Loveland has no overnight facilities. However, inexpen - sive lodging is available in Georgetown if you plan to ski Loveland a second or third day.

The case caused widespread fear at the time in the San Francisco Bay Area, and attracted nationwide atten - tion. By REGINALD MAJOR Copyright Pacific News Service SAN FRANCISCO — ""I have a gun, I know how to use it, and I'm going to get one of those Zebras before he gets me."" This remark, from one el - derly man to another in a court corridor, highlighted the ten - sion at the opening of the “Ze- bra"" trial in San Francisco on March 3. Inside, all 98 spectator seats, the jury box and an extra row of chairs were filled with 122 prospective jurors, each cran - ing for a look at the four black defendants with short cropped hair sitting in a row behind the defense counsel table. Jesse Cooks, 30, J.C.X. Simon, 28, Manual Moore, 30, and Larry C. Green, 23, are accused of 15 killings and 7 attempted murders between Oct. 20, 1973 and April 16, 1974. They were identified by An - thony C. Harris, an informer, who claims that the four were members of a cult called Death’s Angels, which is dedi- cated to the random killing of whites by blacks. The cult, claimed Harris in his Grand Jury testimony, is a nation - wide division of the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims). All four defendants are Muslims. The killings, most of which occurred when the Symbionese Liberation Army dominated the news, led to the controversial “Operation Zebra.” Police stopped, searched and ques - tioned over 600 black men in San Francisco. This massive search was declared uncon - stitutional by a federal judge. At one point, after five people were shot in one night, a police department suggested that whites stay off the street after dark —a statement which increased the tension within the city. Defense Attorney Clinton White entered the case initially in May, 1974, after seven men had been arrested and charged with being the Zebra killers. He remained in the case after four of the men had been released for lack of evidence and rep - resented Simon, Moore and Green. When it became appa - rent that a complicated trial would result, White associated two other attorneys in the case — Edward |acko of New York City, a lawyer specializing in handling cases for the Muslims, and John Cruickshank, White’s law partner. White insists each defendant should be represented by his own attorney. He argues there is a possible conflict of interest between the defendants, one which requires separate representation. Judge Joseph Karesh ruled the attorneys should collec - tively represent the defendants, a procedure which would greatly reduce the amount of time involved in cross examin - ing witnesses. White im - mediately appealed this deci - sion to a higher court which in turn denied his petition. He then appealed to the California Supreme Court. Cooks is represented by Roger Pierucci, a court ap - pointed attorney. Attorney Jacko was not pre - sent the first day, and this caused further controversy. White asked Judge Karesh to delay the trial one week so that Jacko could recover from an illness. Karesh compromised by beginning jury selection, and then recessing the case for two days —by which point Jacko was present. But White comp - lains that Jacko has not had the benefit of seeing the entire jury panel and making decisions about them. The task of selecting a jury which can judge the case is a formidable one. The panel is overwhelmingly white, and has been subject to intense pre-trial publicity. It was San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto himself who announced the existence of Death’s Angels.

Mark Gabriel March 11, 1975 Thanks The Boulder Slavic Dance En - semble would like to thank all the people involved in the fourth annual Slavic Festival held Satur - day, March 8 (Fairview High School folk dancers, Arvada High School folk dancer, CU Russian Chorus, Dave Morton's Band, etc.). We particularly send our congratualtions and gratitude to the CU Department of Slavic Languages who, by their effort and preparation, made this joy - ous occasion possible. Special thanks goes out to the most en - thusiastic and warm audience we have ever performed for. We deem it an honor and a privilege to have been invited once again. Bolshoye Spasiba Brian Lehmann March 12, 1974 Dogs The problem of dogs in Boul - der County can be solved with - out hardships to owners by taking a middle course between dogs being permitted to run free and the restrictions of a county-wide leash law. The solution is to re - quire restriction of all dogs except neutered males and spayed females. (1) Neutered males and spayed females are characteristically un - aggressive; many even lose ag - gressiveness after being ""fixed."" They do not roam. They often have a calming effect on aggres- sive, unneutered males. (2) This solution would provide a strong incentive for dog owners to have their pets spayed and neutered. (J) This in turn would im - mediately control the dog popu - lation explosion. It is always desirable that a re - strictive statute or ordinance should include some non - restrictive, socially desirable in - centive. A dog-control law that exempts neutered and spayed dogs (with appropriate tags) would provide such incentive, with fairness to dog owners, non-owners, and dogs. Catherine & John Wrenn Horace Goldberg and Peggy Wrenn Disgusted We would like the staff of the Daily to know we have lost much respect for its newspaper. A newspaper is a direct media to inform the students of what's happening — truthfully. It should not be utilized to mislead and lie to its readers. We feel this has been done. We were convinced to go see Memories within Miss Aggie upon reading a very posi - tive review favoring and recom - mending the movie highly. Not only did the movie suck but we were robbed of $1 50. The movie was not at all what the re - view said and we were thoroughly disgusted. We stayed for the entire showing under the assumption that it would improve according to the review. We feel we were lead under false pre - tenses and truly taken. The au - thor of the write-up should be shot. Patti Held Bobbie Boss . March 12, 1975 MAR.RAI'S CIVICS IESSON Rights For Richard Moore to accuse the Boulder Committee Against Racism of inventing a utopia and forcing it on others is totally ab - surd and demonstrates nothing more than an utter lack of know - ledge on his part [""Coercion,"" advice/dissent, March I 2], Last February the UCSU funded one -half the money necessary to send three people to Boston for the National Con - ference Against Racism. The arts and science government funded one-half the money necessary to send six people. The remaining funds for the initial six individuals (representatives of BSA, DMAS, Oyate and both funding student governments) were raised elsewhere. The student govern - ments at CSU, UNC and DU also paid transportation for represen - tatives from their campus. Others went with money raised from the community. In all, representa - tives from over 1 30 campuses participated in the Boston con - ference. And yes, Richard, there are elections on this campus in which students select their rep - resentatives for just this type of thing. It was at this National Confer - ence that an on-going organiza - tion was proposed, and adopted almost unanimously, to fight against the racist offensive in this country. As a student group open to anyone interested in fighting racism, the Boulder Committee will go through regular channels for future funding, along with every single other student group on this campus. What bothers me most, Richard, is trying to balance your courageous stand against racism and your complete unwilling - ness, not to Do anything about racism, but even to support those who are. To accuse the Commit - tee, which wants to be as broad and massive as possible, of shov - ing some narrow dictatorship on staunch defenders of human rights and dignity, such as your - self, is an obvious contradiction.
